# SLC
- "Social Lean Canvas" UI component library.

### Description
A shareable common language for modelling “Social Enterprise” and “Impact Driven Business.” The dimensions of “purpose” and “impact” are woven into standard business modelling notation (a "canvas"). When done right this provides a clear pathway to simplifying the complexity inherent in building “impact driven business.”
