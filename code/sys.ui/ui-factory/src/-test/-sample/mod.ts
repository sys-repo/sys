/**
 * @module Test Samples
 *
 * Public-facing sample registrations and schemas for **type-inference and validation tests**.

 *    - Intended for **external consumer tests** (e.g. JSR dry-publish checks).
 *    - JSR-safe: every exported symbol has an explicit type.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT part of the production API surface — for testing and examples only.
