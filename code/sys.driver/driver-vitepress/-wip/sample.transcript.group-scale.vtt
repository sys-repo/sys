1
00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:01.735
This is a model for understanding

2
00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.335
and working with group scale.

3
00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.775
Fundamentally, group dynamics exist at

4
00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:07.935
different group sizes.

5
00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:10.735
Things that work reliably at one scale

6
00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.335
create chaos at another.

7
00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:14.615
These dynamics have been analyzed

8
00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:16.015
and mapped now for decades.

9
00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:21.215
This diagram outlines a group scale model that you can use

10
00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:24.135
to inform the design of human systems like DAOs.

11
00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:27.075
This model is not a fixed model.

12
00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.435
We are constantly testing it against organizational designs

13
00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:32.835
in the real world so

14
00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.195
that we can iterate it based on actual experimental results.

15
00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:41.435
This diagram splits effective group size across three

16
00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.155
fundamentally different scales, which are defined

17
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.995
as firstly, collaboration scale,

18
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:52.275
then coordination scale, and finally broadcast scale.

19
00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.155
Starting on the left is collaboration scale.

20
00:00:57.995 --> 00:00:59.595
Collaboration here is defined

21
00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:03.035
as sharing novel ideas in a productive way

22
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:04.395
to produce something new.

23
00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.665
Getting to group coherence is the critical thing.

24
00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:12.865
A group size of one is obviously the easiest size

25
00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.185
to reach coherence at.

26
00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.665
This is because with only one brain,

27
00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.625
there's no communication overhead.

28
00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.585
As we increase the group size from two to three

29
00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:26.465
and beyond, we get more diversity of perspectives and ideas

30
00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.625
and a greater possibility of useful new innovation emerging.

31
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.505
But in order to stay in group coherence,

32
00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:38.785
we also get exponentially increasing communication overhead.

33
00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.865
It requires more and more effort to create group coherence,

34
00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.705
and it gets easier and easier for the group

35
00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:47.625
to fall into chaotic patterns.

36
00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:51.825
At around 10 people, group collaboration becomes impossible,

37
00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:54.185
and chaos or some other group

38
00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:56.025
anti-patent becomes inevitable.

39
00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:01.065
Above 10 people, we transition to coordination. Scale.

40
00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.625
Coordination here is defined

41
00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:08.065
as successfully working together on well understood

42
00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:10.585
activities to produce predictable outcomes.

43
00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:15.795
Coordination scale can start at two people,

44
00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:18.755
but it becomes necessary above 10 people.

45
00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:23.475
As collaboration becomes impossible at coordination scale,

46
00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:26.115
people can understand what needs to be done

47
00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.035
and can utilize processes

48
00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:31.435
and relationships to effectively do things together.

49
00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.675
Group coherence is achieved by constraining the group

50
00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.915
to well understood processes.

51
00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:42.715
At about 150 humans, we lose the ability

52
00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:46.555
to coordinate based on limits to our capacity to relate

53
00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:47.995
to larger group sizes.

54
00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:50.195
This is known as the Dunbar number

55
00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:52.835
where coordination becomes difficult

56
00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:55.835
as the group becomes too large for individuals

57
00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:58.875
to navigate effectively. So at this point,

58
00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.155
We transition to broadcast scale.

59
00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:05.745
Broadcast scale is 150 people plus

60
00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:08.145
and is about large groups of people

61
00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.545
participating in highly constrained ways.

62
00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:15.585
Interaction is maximally constrained to consumption

63
00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.865
of media, voting on limited sets of options,

64
00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:21.745
and using scalable interfaces such

65
00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:23.385
as interacting with products.

66
00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:27.255
The set of possible outcomes at broadcast scale

67
00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:28.775
is extremely limited.

68
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:34.395
The overarching pattern that you'll be able to see here is

69
00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.235
that on the left, the number

70
00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:38.515
of potential outcomes is greatest

71
00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.915
because the system is least constrained.

72
00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:44.355
And as we move to the right, the system needs

73
00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:47.315
to become more constrained, limiting the number

74
00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:49.275
of potential outcomes to present

75
00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:51.875
to prevent the system falling into chaos.

76
00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:55.435
So the larger the group scale,

77
00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:57.915
the greater the constraints needed

78
00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:00.555
and the smaller the number of possible outcomes.

79
00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:04.235
And conversely, the smaller the group scale,

80
00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:06.555
the fewer the constraints needed

81
00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:09.075
and the greater the field of possible outcomes.
